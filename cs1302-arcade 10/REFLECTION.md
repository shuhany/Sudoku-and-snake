1. **DONE:** Finished implementing our respective games.
   **DONE:** Combined our games and the main window together.

2. **TODO:** Submit.

3. **PROB:** Snake works fine on partner's, Stephen Embler, Windows laptop,
		but is very laggy on my, Shuhan Yang's, Mac laptop. Posted on Piazza
		about this issue, and considering submitting on two separate laptops to 
		demonstrate that our programs work as intended.
		This issue arose after combining our programs together into one cohesive whole.
4. EXTRA CREDIT: We submitted our team application by the original time, Snake also has a highscore option.
